      <description>My first VSCode Extension I&amp;rsquo;ve been using VSCode as my editor of choice for quite a while now. It&amp;rsquo;s a really well-made editor for programmers, featuring many community made high quality extensions.
One of the features I use quite often is multiple selection. You can edit many places at the same time entering the same text. What I was missing however, was an easy to use feature where I could insert a sequence of numbers, for example to do array access.</description>
