# The Programmer's Diet

## Why you should listen to me

First to introduce myself. I’m a 30 year old software engineer. I was never particularly lean. I’m still not what you would call super fit. And I’m not a doctor. I’m 180cm (5’11”) tall and weigh in at 88Kg (194lbs). So you’re asking yourself why of all people I’m writing a post on diet.

Let me explain. I believe metabolisms are different. Of course there are some thermodynamic limits to how much fat a body can store from food, but there’s basically no limit to how much a body can waste. My dad was always skinny, but he ate about three times the amount I’m eating right now, and that at a higher age. Most of my really skinny friends appear to be eating huge amounts. And that’s before they eat dessert! On top of that a lot of them don’t exercise at all. If I listened to their advice and ate and exercised the same I’d get seriously fat.

Listening to skinny friends for dietary advice is something I’ve ruled out for myself. It doesn’t make sense to ask someone with no experience in dieting how to diet, right? I also know fat people eating huge amounts that don’t exercise, so they’re not a source I can trust either. Maybe there’s no sense in dieting at all and we’re all victims of our metabolisms?

I should actually be happy, because what’s considered a *bad* metabolism today, is what might have kept one of my (maternal) ancestors alive in war time. When food is scarce you don’t want a body that wastes all those precious calories. However I’ve never really experienced food scarcity in my life (luckily). Besides, it doesn’t help envying other people. You’re not them, don’t think about it.

The result is that I’ve always been trying to keep my weight at a good level. At times I’ve let it slide a bit and my weight would go up. Last year I weighed in at 96Kg (212lbs).

I decided that I need to do something.

# Exercise

Programmer’s, and a lot of other office drones, are very sedentary creatures. No wonder a lot of us are getting fat. This is why I dedicate this article to programmers. The nature of our job makes us so much less likely to move enough.

So my first recourse was exercise. I had been doing some Karate in university, so when I met a friend who was doing Kung Fu I thought I should join the club. After all it’s easier to exercise if there are others exercising with you.

I was really not in shape. After just 5 minutes in the first class I felt I was dying. But I kept going as best I could. After a few weeks my body adjusted and I was able to keep up with most exercises throughout the 2h class, twice a week.

I was also reading [Scott Adam’s *How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4) at the time, and he said that you should exercise at least 1/2h daily. According to Scott it’s because it doesn’t take any willpower to keep up a habit. It does take willpower to do something that’s not a habit. So whenever I had time I filled my evenings where I wasn’t doing Kung-Fu with half an hour jogs.

Over the course of a few months I saw my weight dropping. However the progress stalled after only about 5 months. I was at 91Kg (201lbs).

If you think about it, half an hour jog should be roughly 400kcal according to my FitBit. That’s not even breakfast. However if you do that all week, you get 2800kcal. But how much do these calories mean?

[1 pound of human fatty tissue contains about 3500kcal](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calories/art-20048065). However if you think you’re losing 41.6 pounds in a year where you jog every day for half an hour you’re wrong. Your body can become more efficient in various ways, e.g. by lowering body temperature or cannibalizing muscles. So your calory deficit has to be a lot higher than what you believe from back of the envelope calculations.

# Food

There are two main ways to lose calories. Food and exercise. Surgery would be a third option, but a little bit extreme. There are a few options for saving calories on food.

If you think however that just eating less is easy, you don’t know the human body. On paper most people can tell you how to diet perfectly. In practice it’s much more difficult. You start getting cravings that become impossible to ignore. Scott Adam’s book really helped me on this aspect again. He proposes what he calls the *Persuasion Diet*. The idea is, that you can’t count on your willpower, or as he says *willpower is an illusion*, instead you must change your environment and the types of food you eat, so you will crave less.

## Change #1: Sugar

I had paid attention to not eating *more*, but I hadn’t changed my diet from before. So now I decided to start with one of the most evil things in our food. *Sugar*.

Sugar lets your insulin spike up for a short time. When your body finished metabolizing the sugar your body is still pumping insulin through your veins (and your brain). That is the addictive power behind sugar. Eating sugar, makes you want more sugar.

So I decided I wouldn’t eat crêpes as often anymore, I wouldn’t keep chocolate at home (deadly for relationships by the way) and I wouldn’t put a spoonful of sugar in my coffee or tea anymore.

As soon as I had accustomed to not having any of these around, I did experience less cravings. Besides, as we all know too much sugar can cause Type II Diabetes, which in turn can give you cancer and other health problems. Sugar is just not good for you. Point. And it gets easier to eat less sugar, the less sugar you eat. Quite the opposite to eating less food, which in general does make you want to eat more.

## Change #2: Carbohydrates

There are two main sources of calories in our food. Carbohydrates and fats. While fats are more dense in calories, carbohydrates have come under more intense scrutiny in recent years. While in the 90s everything fat free was considered diet food, now we know that the sugar they replaced the fat with is much more dangerous.

Simple carbohydrates, like white bread, pasta, and rice, have a similar effect on your insulin levels like sugar. Complex carbohydrates, which you find in whole wheat bread and pasta, take a bit longer to digest, and don’t lead to insulin spikes as much. So one way to keep your body from wanting more food is switching the type of carbs you eat.

I found that another thing helps here, which is eating less carbs in general. I tried going full Keto a few years a ago, but that was too hard for me. Instead what I propose is to replace some of your carbs with veggies.

Your normal plate of food probably looks like this:

A much more healthy variant, should look like this:

## Change #3: Portion control

If you’ve read the book [Nudge](http://nudges.org/) you might be familiar with one way to reduce portion sizes effortlessly. By tricking your brain. The idea is simple, by smaller plates, and you will eat less. I’ve found this little mindhack works wonders.

# Summary

These are the ways I reduced my weight from 96Kg to 88Kg in one year. I’ve been keeping it steady at 88Kg for 5 months now, even dipping down to 86Kg while hiking on vacation, although I did gain those 2Kg back again. I added rock-climbing to my hobbies, which is a great way to have fun, nevermind the weight loss goals.

Right now I’m experimenting with leaving out breakfast. I know that many say it’s the most important meal of the day, but I found I acually eat less at lunch if I didn’t have breakfast. My stomach isn’t stretched as much I guess. So that’s a double calorie saver. Let’s see how it goes. It’s also another 500kcal deficit to add to the list.

Adding together my hobbies and my food intake I’m running at about 1200kcal less per day than in the beginning of last year. If calorie counting estimations worked, I’d be dead from starvation. That last bit of fat is still holding on tight though.

Wherever you are on your weight loss journey. I wish you success!
